My final project will revolve around weather. Weather has a very artistic/emotional aspect of it, so I think it'll be something cool to incorporate into a visual project. Furthermore, I  hope to attach an emotion with each weather so that each diagram has its own emotional story.

The three forms of weather I will be portraying will be:

1. Rain

This will likely be a page with programmed rain. Ideally, I animate someone in the rain, where clicking the person can add features to the page (maybe increase/decrease rain speed). This page should be programmed with HTML, CSS animation, and Javascript (a button on the person). The emotion that I plan to add with this is sadness. 


2. Fire

I think this diagram can focus on the chaos of fire. I think I'm planning to do a simple picture of someone knocking over a candle. The fire lights the page, and eventually engulfs the whole page. This could be portrated with HTML canvas. The emotion I plan to this weather is anger.

3. Wind

This will be a moving diagram, following the path of a leaf. While this is still a preliminary thought, I wish to create a page that will basically move to focus on a single object. The emotion I plan to add this diagram is peacefulness. Ideally it'll be a placid drawing.

Ultimately, I wish to paint a story with a single wordless page that not only expresses an element, but also an emotion.
