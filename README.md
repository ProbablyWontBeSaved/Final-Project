My final project will revolve around the weather. Weather has a very artistic/emotional aspect of it, so I think it'll be something cool to incorporate into a visual project. Furthermore, I  hope to attach emotion with each weather so that each diagram has its own emotional story.

The three forms of weather I will be portraying will be:

1. Rain

This will likely be a page with programmed rain. Ideally, I animate someone in the rain, where clicking an object can add features to the page (maybe increase/decrease rain speed). This page should be programmed with HTML, CSS animation, and Javascript (a button on the object). The emotion that I plan to add with this is placidness. Therefore, I plan to make a desolate rainy scene.


2. Fire

I think this diagram can focus on the scariness of fire. While fire itself can be very scary, I think I'll make a campfire that can be programmed to increase in size. With each size increase, the fire will reveal a scary background image. With this, there's an emotional aspect of fear involved.

3. Wind

This will be a diagram, similar to the other ones where html, css, and javascript are key aspects. The emotion I plan to add this diagram is isolation. Therefore, with a click of an object, I want to make all the things on the screen disappear.

Ultimately, I wish to paint a story with a single wordless page that not only expresses an element, but also an emotion.
