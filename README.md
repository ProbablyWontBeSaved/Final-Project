For my final project, I was planning on doing something that expresses me (sort of like an About Me page). 
Of the three diagrams, one of it will be related to my heritage. My Chinese ethnicity is a large part of my identity, that is why I feel like it is necessary when describing myself. 

Another aspect of myself that I'd like to portray is my hobbies and interests. Something that I feel is another part of my identity are my interests. Some interests that I could list are Tennis and Saxophone, both subjects being a major part of my childhood. I feel like I should dedicate a diagram for it, as it is a chunk in my life. 

The third diagram I will dedicate to my personal life. This is where my friends and family belong. I think this would best be portrayed using images in a slideshow format. While a simple slideshow may be too boring, an option is to have images of my friends and family thrown into the window screen. Thus, you see a mass of pictures, though too many and too fast to fully appreciate.

Finally music has always been a major part in my life. Each of these diagrams should have a musical background to it, maybe Chinese music for the Heritage diagram. I was in Jazz and Marching band, so there could also be a saxophone song in the background of my Interest diagram.
